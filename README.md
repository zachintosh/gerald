[Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) is a practice that dates back to the stone ages. Pre-dating the turing machine itself, the use of a rubber duck to debug has solved programming issues helped get us to the moon*. 

Gerald, who has taken the mantle of our physical, beloved, floatatious friends, offers his humble heritage and experience in solving _your_ problems. And, instead of being a space-hogging, yellow-radiating pile of rubber, Gerald comes in modern, sleek, beautiful curves, born in the writhing fires of CSS.
