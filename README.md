[Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) is a practice that dates back to the stone ages. Pre-dating the turing machine itself, the use of a rubber duck to debug has solved programming issues helped get us to the moon*. 

Gerald, who has taken the mantle of our since-passed beloved floatatious friends, offers his humble heritage and experience in solving _your_ problems.

Can't solve a bug? **Talk to Gerald.**
